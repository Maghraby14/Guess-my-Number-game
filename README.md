## Introduction

The Guess My Number Game is a classic number guessing game where the computer attempts to guess the number you have chosen. Your role is to guide the computer by indicating whether its guess is too high or too low until it correctly guesses your number.

## Screens

### Enter Number Screen

On this screen, you enter a number between 10 and 100. This is the number that the computer will try to guess. Ensure that the number is within the specified range to proceed.

### Game Screen

In the game screen, the computer will start guessing the number you entered. You will see two buttons:

- `+`: Click this button if the computer's guess is lower than your number.
- `-`: Click this button if the computer's guess is higher than your number.

The computer will continue to make new guesses based on your inputs until it correctly guesses your number.
